## Description

Knitters from all over can relate to feeling the motivation to create something beautiful - but another thing they can relate to is not knowing where to start. Introducing Purly, a simplified application that renders a pattern for our users depending on specific inputs. Tell us your skill-level, what type of yarn you like to work with, even needle size! No need to worry about endless browsing online - everything is here for you already! Well, as we like to say here at Purly, "let's make something!".

## Challenge Criteria

- Use React for the front end.

- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Include authentication (JWT).

- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
